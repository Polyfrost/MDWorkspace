# Markdown Workspace
This repository acts as an Obsidian vault to use in creating, editing, and formatting markdown files used in Polyfrost repositories and products. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful markdown editor with revolutionary features, including a live preview of formatted markdown text, which is very helpful.
The use of this repository is optional. Some may prefer to use other markdown editors such as GitHub web, Notepad++, VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, or other IDEs. You are free to use your preferred method for editing markdowns.
## Getting Started
1. Download and install Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). 
2. Clone this GitHub repository using your preferred method. 
3. Launch/open Obsidian.
4. Select **Open folder as vault** in the initial window, as shown below.

### Using Obsidian
A complete list of tools for using Obsidian can be found on their [help portal](https://help.obsidian.md/). However, most of the concepts explained in the help portal are too advanced for use in simple markdown editing. In this case, it is probably only beneficial to read through the concepts in the **How to** section.
